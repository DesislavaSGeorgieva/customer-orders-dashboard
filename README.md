Mini SQL project: relational database of customers and their orders
# Customer Orders Dashboard

This is a mini SQL portfolio project that simulates a relational database of customers and their orders.  
The project includes realistic business queries, such as:

- Number of orders per customer
- Total order amount per country
- Highest-value order and customer
- Filtering by order status
- Joining `customers` and `orders` tables

## 🔧 Technologies used
- MySQL (via XAMPP & phpMyAdmin)
- SQL (JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, aggregate functions)
- GitHub for portfolio tracking

## 🙋‍♀️ About me

My name is Desislava Georgieva. I’m transitioning into the tech world after earning a PhD in Art History and over a decade of analytical work.  
I am currently focused on learning SQL and data analytics, building real projects from scratch.  
My dream is to work remotely in tech, contribute to meaningful data solutions, and protect the place I call home.
